# About
A repository that hosts my personal blog.
# Techs used
Html, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Python, Django, Postgres
# Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability, but almost always for design purposes.
# Lessons Learned
While working on this blog project, I picked up some really valuable lessons. One of the coolest things I learned was how important it is to understand Django's view-based templates. I got the hang of creating a login and logout system, and I even figured out how to handle static files like images, HTML, and CSS. Another awesome thing I learned was how to connect Postgres to Django and deploy it on PythonAnywhere. It was such a great learning experience!
